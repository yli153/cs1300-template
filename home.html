    <h2 class="display-6">Personas and Storyboarding of an Authentic Oven</h2>
    <p class="lead intro"> <strong>
        Project Oven's main objective is to step into a user's shoes. Based on first-hand observations of real 
        users interacting with the interface of an oven and interviews about their experiences, personas are created 
        and storyboard is used to illustrate the user experience for one particular persona.</strong>

      <h2 style="text-align: center; white-space: pre-wrap;">Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Oven is one of the most commonly used home appliances. The oven interface (i.e., the control panel) interacts with the users and 
        allows them to cook food with their desired specifications. Its key components include the following:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>cooking modes touchpads which let users select different cooking modes</li>
          <li>a display screen which visually prompts and shows users’ input of cooking specifications</li>
          <li>numeric touchpads for users to put in numbers</li>
          <li>feature buttons such as oven timer, oven light, oven clear/off, etc.</li>
        </ol> 
      <p> Users need to conduct a series of actions on the control panel to input all the required cooking specifications and get the 
        oven to work. The figure below shows the exact Bosch oven I have at home. </p>
      </div>
      
      <img class="oven" src="images/interface.JPG" alt="annotated oven interface">
      <p class="font-weight-bold">I then wonder: How does each user's experience differ? Is this oven designed for everyone? I decided to figure this out 
        and asked three unique users the following questions:</p> 
      <ol>
        <li>What was your first impression of this interface?</li>
        <li>Which aspects of this interface are in line with your expectations? Which ones are not?</li>
        <li>What was your experience like using this interface for the first time? How did you feel?</li>
        <li>What is your experience like using this interface now? How do you feel now? Any differences from the first time?</li> 
        <li>How long did it take for you to become familiar with the interface?</li>
        <li>What do you like about this interface? What do you not like about this interface?</li>
        <li>How many times per week do you use the oven? What features on the interface do you use the most frequently?</li>
        <li>What is your typical routine or step-by-step procedure when using this interface?</li>
        <li>What are some of the challenges you have met when using this interface?</li>
        <li>What are some of the improvements on this interface that you wish to see?</li>
        <li>Describe one experience you had with this interface that you can recall most vividly.</li>
        <li>On a scale of 1 to 10 (i.e, 1 is the least satisfied and 10 is the most satisfied), how would you rate your first-time experience?</li>
        <li>On the same scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your experience on average now?</li>
        <li>On a scale of 1 to 10 (i.e., 1 is without any difficulty and 10 is extremely difficult), how would you rate the level of difficulty in learning how to use this interface?</li>
        <li>On a scale of 1 to 10 (i.e., 1 is the least effective and 10 is the most effective), how would you rate the effectiveness of this interface in achieving its functionality?</li>

        <h2 style="text-align: center; white-space: pre-wrap;">Observations</h2>
        <p>I approached Susan, Richard and Yvonne and observed how they interact with the oven interface. In general, all of them took pauses at some point in using the 
          interface. They all somewhat referred back to the display screen after completing an action and reacted to the beep sounds. Unlike Susan 
          who did not hesitate when starting the oven, Richard observed the entire interface and Yvonne looked at the different cooking modes. 
          However, Susan had to restart because she lost track of what she was trying to do and accidentally hit “Oven Clear/Off”. Among the three, 
          Richard took the most amount of time to observe the interface and display screen between steps. There was no obvious hesitation in Yvonne’s 
          operations, in contrast to Susan and Richard who both hesitated for one or more times. In addition, Yvonne was the only one who seemed 
          to think about different cooking modes and made a different choice from the other two users who both chose “Bake”. </p>

        <p> I then sat down and interviewed each user. Susan, Richard and Yvonne all mention that the different buttons on the interface are hard to understand 
          and confused them initially. They all think that there is some to considerable amount of difficulty in 
          learning how to use this interface. All of their experiences have been improved since their first time using the interface; 
          however, Richard particularly dislikes the current setup of the interface and thinks it is fairly ineffective, giving a rating of 5. 
          Unlike Yvonne, Susan and Richard do not change their step-by-step procedure and only have used one cooking mode. All of them like 
          the beep sound which helps them evaluate whether they have done things correctly and would refer to the display screen in using the 
          interface.

                <p>At first sight, Susan thinks that the interface is very <strong>“hard to understand”</strong> and shows <strong>“too many words”</strong>. 
                  Though the functions on the interface align with her expectations, the impacts of her actions are <strong>“mostly different from 
                  what she expects”</strong>. She did not get the oven to work and felt <strong>“confused”</strong> when using it for the first time and ended up 
                  asking for someone else’s help. She feels more familiar with using this interface now but <strong>“sometimes needs to start over”</strong>.</p> 
                <p>Susan uses this oven 3-4 times per week but has only used the mode “Bake” regardless of the type of food. 
                  She follows the same procedure: <strong>“Bake” => set temperature => “Enter” to start preheating; after preheating is done, 
                  “Oven timer” => set time” => “Enter”</strong>. Susan likes the modern design and the beep sound at the press of a button but does 
                  not like the <strong>“overwhelming number of buttons”</strong>. </p>
                <p>Susan would like to see <strong>"different functions being separated more clearly and presented in a way that is easier to memorize"</strong>. 
                  She suggests that <strong>“icons and figures can perhaps replace the words”</strong>. She rates her first-time experience as 2 and recent 
                  experiences as 7. She also rates the difficulty of learning the interface as 7 and the effectiveness of the interface as 6. She recalls the memory of feeling puzzled and 
                  ending up calling a friend when using the interface for the first time. </p>

                <p>Richard’s first impression of the interface is that it gives a sense of <strong>“high-end and advanced technology”</strong> but has 
                  <strong>“dazzling functions which are hard to understand”</strong>. The <strong>presentation of the interface is different from his expectations</strong>; he expects 
                  to see the main icons to be different food types (i.e., meat, vegetables, bread) with one extra button to “customize”. He further 
                  explains that once you select a food type, the display screen shall then direct you to select one of the possible cooking modes specific to this food type. </p>
                  
                <p>Richard’s first time using the interface was entirely under the guidance of someone else and felt that <strong>“the required 
                  number of steps were more than he expected”</strong>. He uses the oven once every two or three weeks and only uses “Bake”. 
                  Richard considers the other cooking modes as <strong>“redundant”</strong> and is <strong>confused about why there are both “kitchen timer” and “over timer”</strong>.</p>
                
                <p>Richard appreciates the beep sound and the display screen which shows the immediate result of his actions but wants 
                  to redesign and reorganize the icons. He rates his first-time experience as 4 and recent experiences as 7. He 
                  also rates the difficulty of learning the interface as 6 and the effectiveness of the interface as 5. Richard remembers 
                 feeling confused by “kitchen timer” and “oven timer” and having to think about which one to choose. </p>

                  buttons take some time to go through”</strong>. <strong>The presentation of the interface aligns with her expectations</strong>, especially the 
                  various cooking modes, numeric touchpads, display screen and oven timer. Before using the interface for the first time, she read the 
                  instructions manual and learned about the different features. She thought the manual "gave clear explanations” and was able 
                  to figure out the correct way to use the interface. </p>
                <p>Yvonne thinks that she is now <strong>“confident about using any feature on the interface”</strong>. She uses the oven once per week 
                  on weekends usually for baking sweet treats and enjoys trying out new recipes with the oven. She particularly appreciates the display

        <p> Based on the three users I observed and interviewed, I have created two personas represented by the empathy maps:
          "Overwhelmed Olivia" and "Inquisitive Ivan".</p>
          <ol>
            <li> "Overwhelmed Olivia" is a 52 year-old mother of the household who prepare all three meals for her family every day.
                  She uses the oven 3 or 4 times per week but still feels overwhelmed when she messes up with any of the steps to set up 
                  the oven. The many different buttons on the interface confuse her and she would lose track of what to do. 
                  "Overwhelmed Olivia" represents the group of users (usually middle-aged or older) who sometimes need to cook with the oven under certain time 
                  constraints and feel frustrated by their misoperation. 
            </li>
            <li> "Inquisitive Ivan" is an 18 year-old high school student who bakes and cooks occasionally in his spare time.
                  Though he only uses the oven once in a while, he is able to learn how to use new technologies quickly and is the
                  go-to person at home if anyone has a question about the oven. Ivan mainly uses the oven for fun and is curious about
                  all its different features. "Inquisitive Ivan" represents the group of younger users who do not feel pressured to cook 
                  or bake, but rather enjoy exploring new recipes with the different features of an advanced oven.
